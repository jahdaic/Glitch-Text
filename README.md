# Glitch Text
A simple JavaScript plugin that can be used to add a variety of glitching text effects to a website.

__NOTE:__ This is basically a proof-of-concept currently and needs some refinement. It works, but currently has a couple of drawbacks and does no yet implement all glitch types that are planned.
